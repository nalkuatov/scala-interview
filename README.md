## scala interview

This contains solutions for some exercises (mostly about algorithms) I was asked to solve as a coding part of an interview.
Read the problem statements [here](https://github.com/nalkuatov/scala-interview/blob/master/problem_statements.txt).

*There are bunches of **function level docs** that explain some unobvious details.*

You can run tests on each separate module: 
 * Just go to the root of the project (which contains `build.sbt` file)
 * Run `sbt circular-pursuit/test` or `sbt maze-runner/test`
